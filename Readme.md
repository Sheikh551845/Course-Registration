## Questions

**Topic 1: Add at least 3 Project features**

A: 1. We see course cards with course details.<br> 
   2. Their is a credit limit if you cross the limit then it will show warn.<br>
   3. We can't select a course twice.

**Topic 2: Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.**

A: I manage the state in my assignment by using React's Hook.<br>
  Generally React's Hooks are:<br>
  useState<br>
  useEffect<br>
  useContext<br>
  useReducer<br>
  useRef<br>
  useMemo<br>
  useCallback<br>
  useLayoutEffect<br>
  useDebugValue<br>

  But i used useState and useEffect only.
